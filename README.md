# ShootThis-Backend

A 2D HTML5 shooter, using the [Phaser 3](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/) engine.

This is the backend server, written in Java. The database used in the creation process was MariaDB, but any MySQL fork should work. The storage engine used was InnoDB.

**Please note that this is the backend version, the backbone of [ShootThis-Web](https://github.com/mtsanovv/ShootThis-Web).**

## About the SQL file included
This is the structure of the database that is used for ShootThis **and it is required by both the frontend and the backend.**
